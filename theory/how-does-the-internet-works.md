# How does the internet works?

> The internet is a wire buried in the ground. It can be fiber optic, copper or through phone network or satellites.

- Two computers connected directly to this wire can communicate.

- A **server** is a special computer connected directly to the internet and webpages are files on that server hard drive.

- Every server has a unique protocol address (**IP**), that helps computers find each other, and a **name** (google.com).

Traditional computers are not servers because they're not connected directly to the internet. They are instead called **clients** because they are connected indirectly to the internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

To send an email, your server is moving your message to the server of the email you are sending to and the email is retrieved by the recipient.

When an email, a picture or a web page travel across the internet, computers break the information into smaller pieces called **packets**, when information reaches his destination the packets are reassembled in their original order.

Anywhere to or more parts of the internet intersect there's a piece of equipment called **router**. Routers direct your packets around the internet, helping each packet get one step closer to its destination.
Every time you visit a website, up to 15 routers may help your packets find their way to and from your computer.

Every time the packet reaches a new router another layer is added until it reaches the server. Then, when the server send back information, it creates packets with an identical wrapping. As the packet makes its way back each router unwraps a layer, to discover where to send the packet next, until it reaches your computer.
