### _Electronic Musician, Web Developer_

#### Who I am?

I come from Italy and I'm 27. I was born in the province of Florence, where Chianti wine is produced.
After high school, I moved to Bologna to study electronic music composition at Music Conservatory. There, I had an incredible experience, I knew a lot of people, I played my music in many places and I passed really good moments.

After that I came here in Brussels, with my girlfriend, to try to find work in music sector as DJ and live music player, but then Covid arrived. That was boring 'cause we super enjoyed the city when we arrived, and I had to start to play in some events but everything was canceled.

Since I started my studies in music I was passionated about _code_ in music and I started to use some programming language to compose music and create audio effects.

Lately I decided to convert my passion for technology into something real so I started to study code by myself, and after 6 months here I am starting this journey at **BeCode**!

> Right now I kind of thank Covid because without it I would not have found out IT world, which I love more and more.
